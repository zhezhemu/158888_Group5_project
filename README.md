About virtual machines:
Why upload to Onedrive?
Because this virtual machine is too large (about 80GB), it contains the Hadoop cluster and database installed by our team (the database has been uploaded in this project), which is the key to running the data warehouse.
Of course, it is not necessary to run this virtual machine completely, because we only perform the data processing part on the virtual machine. You can view the processed data and SQL code in the library I uploaded.

If you want to use a virtual machine to view the data processing process, please refer to the "Virtual Machine Usage Document" we uploaded, which contains detailed virtual machine account passwords, how to use the cluster startup script, how to start Hive, etc.Not all data in this project is processed through Hive, and some are also processed through Excel. Please refer to the uploaded chart for details.

Please refer to the 158888_group_5.ipynb file to view the algorithm used in this project.
